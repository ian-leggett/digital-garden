# Django Q Objects for Advanced Queries

Django's ORM provides a powerful way to build complex database queries using `Q` objects. These objects allow you to create complex logical expressions that can be combined using logical operators.

## Basic Q Object Usage

The `Q` object allows you to encapsulate a SQL `WHERE` clause condition. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
from django.db.models import Q

# Find users with first_name starting with 'J' OR last_name starting with 'S'
users = User.objects.filter(
    Q(first_name__startswith='J') | Q(last_name__startswith='S')
)
```

## Logical Operators with Q Objects

Q objects support three main logical operators:

- `|` (OR): Combines conditions where either can be true
- `&` (AND): Combines conditions where both must be true
- `~` (NOT): Negates a condition

### OR Example

```python
# Find products that are either discounted OR featured
products = Product.objects.filter(
    Q(is_discounted=True) | Q(is_featured=True)
)
```

### AND Example

```python
# Find active users who have verified email
active_verified_users = User.objects.filter(
    Q(is_active=True) & Q(email_verified=True)
)

# This is equivalent to the standard filter syntax:
# User.objects.filter(is_active=True, email_verified=True)
```

### NOT Example

```python
# Find products that are NOT out of stock
in_stock_products = Product.objects.filter(
    ~Q(stock_count=0)
)
```

### When to Use Q Objects
Use Q objects when:

- You need OR conditions in your queries
- You're building queries dynamically based on user input
- You need complex combinations of AND, OR, and NOT operations
- You want to reuse query conditions across multiple queries
- Q objects make Django's ORM even more powerful by allowing you to express virtually any SQL query in a Pythonic way.
